# AI-SOC-Automator
This project demonstrates the creation of a cloud-native Security Operations Center (SOC) that integrates Elastic SIEM, Elastic Defend (EDR), and AI-driven automation. Built on Microsoft Azure, the foundation is a Windows Server virtual machine, which streams real-time logs, telemetry, and alerts into a centralized SIEM for monitoring and analysis.
